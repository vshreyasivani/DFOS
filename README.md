#  Distributed File Orchestration and Synchronization (DFOS)

A multi-client authenticated file transfer system in Python using socket programming. The server handles multiple clients concurrently, each with isolated file operations.

##  Project Structure

```
DFOS/
├── server.py               # Server handling concurrent clients via threads
├── client.py               # CLI interface for user operations
├── id_passwd.txt           # Stored credentials for login
├── server_storage/         # Per-user folders to isolate files
├── server_performance.log  # CPU/memory logs and server performance
└── README.md
```

---

##  Features

-  User Authentication (via `id_passwd.txt`)
-  Upload File
-  Download File
-  Preview File (first 1024 bytes)
-  List Own Files
-  Delete File
-  Server logs performance: CPU, memory usage
-  Graceful Shutdown (interrupt-safe)
-  Multi-threaded: Handles up to 10 clients concurrently

---

##  How to Run

### 1️⃣ Start the Server

```bash
python3 server.py
```

###  Run a Client (in another terminal)

```bash
python3 client.py
```

###  Login Credentials

Update `id_passwd.txt` with:

```
username:password
```

Example:

```
alice:alice123
bob:bobpass
```

##  Future Work

-  SSL/TLS Support for secure communication
-  Logging & Auditing of user actions
-  Switch to Thread-based implementation for better efficiency
